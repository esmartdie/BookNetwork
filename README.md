# BookNetwork

BookNetwork is a platform designed to provide users with the ability to explore, manage, and interact with a network of book-related data. This project combines a modular design with powerful technologies to ensure scalability and performance.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, edit, and browse through a library of books.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to create profiles, interact with books, and engage with other users.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and responsive front-end developed in TypeScript.
- **Backend Logic**: Built on Java, ensuring robust business logic handling and seamless database interaction.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end:
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript, used for scalable and maintainable front-end code.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies for building the structure and styling of the web application.

### Back-end:
- **Java**: A reliable and widely-used language for building back-end services.
- **Spring Framework** (if applicable): Likely used for creating RESTful services, handling dependency injection, and managing database connectivity.
  
### Docker:
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to ensure that the application can be easily deployed in any environment, making it scalable and portable.

## Architecture

- **Microservices**: The project is structured in a modular fashion, with clear separation between the front-end (book-network-front) and the back-end (book-network).
- **API-Driven**: The back-end likely exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the front-end, enabling a decoupled and scalable system.
- **Docker Support**: Docker configurations are provided to enable easy deployment and testing, ensuring consistency across environments.
